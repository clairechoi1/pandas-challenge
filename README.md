# pandas-challenge

# Description
This coding challenge was part of the edX UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp. The dataset included district-wide standardized test results for reading and math with school and student data. 

# Task
The task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. Using pandas and jupyter lab, calculations were made to create various dataframes (District Summary, School Summary, Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Type).

# Acknowledgement
I received help from the edX bootcamp activity files which included code for creating dataframes, groupbys, calculating average, etc.
